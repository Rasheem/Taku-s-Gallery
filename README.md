Simple Japanese Artist's Static Site
I wanted to make a Static for a friend of mine, but without telling him.
Using BS and other little things I put together a few of his pieces to create a portfolio.
A portfolio that will grow in size as he does, becoming not only longer, but will incorporate interaction.
From transforming img/material lists, to folding pages signifying different a different collection.
